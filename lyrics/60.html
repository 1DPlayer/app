Counted all my mistakes and there's only one<br>
Standing out from the list of the things I've done<br>
All the rest of my crimes don't come close<br>
To the look on your face when I let you go<br>
So I built you a house from a broken home<br>
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke<br>
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out<br>
How to fix up a heart that I let down<br>
Now I'm searching every lonely place<br>
Every corner calling out your name<br>
Tryna find you but I just don't know<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Yeah, the a taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue<br>
Is at the top of the list of the things I want<br>
Mind is running in circles of you and me<br>
Anyone in between is the enemy<br>
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from<br>
Love was something you've never heard enough<br>
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out<br>
How to fix up a heart that I let down<br>
Now I'm searching every lonely place<br>
Every corner calling out your name<br>
Tryna find you but I just don't know<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Are you sleeping, baby by yourself?<br>
Or are you giving it to someone else?<br>
Try to find you but I just don't know<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Tell me now, tell me now,<br>
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid?<br>
Tell me now, tell me now,<br>
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again?<br>
Now I'm searching every lonely place<br>
Every corner calling out your name<br>
Tryna find you but I just don't know<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Are you sleeping, baby, by yourself?<br>
Or are you giving it to someone else?<br>
Try to find you but I just don't know<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Tell me where you're hiding out<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Tell me, 'cause Iâ€™m ten feet down<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Come on, baby, come and get me out<br>
Come on, baby, come and get me out<br>
Come on, baby, 'cause I need you now<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Where do broken hearts go?<br>
Where do broken hearts go?
