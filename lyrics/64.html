Going out tonight<br>
Changes into something red<br>
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress<br>
Everything she never had she's showing off<br>
Driving too fast<br>
Moon is breaking through her hair<br>
She said it was something that she won't forget<br>
Having no regrets is all that she really wants<br>
We're only getting older baby<br>
And I've been thinking about it lately<br>
Does it ever drive you crazy<br>
Just how fast the night changes?<br>
Everything that you've ever dreamed of<br>
Disappearing when you wake up<br>
But there's nothing to be afraid of<br>
Even when the night changes<br>
It will never change me and you<br>
Chasing it tonight,<br>
Doubts are running â€˜round her head<br>
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette<br>
Heart is beating loud, she doesn't want it to stop<br>
Moving too fast<br>
Moon is lighting up her skin<br>
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet<br>
Having no regrets is all that she really wants<br>
We're only getting older baby<br>
And I've been thinking about it lately<br>
Does it ever drive you crazy<br>
Just how fast the night changes?<br>
Everything that you've ever dreamed of<br>
Disappearing when you wake up<br>
But there's nothing to be afraid of<br>
Even when the night changes<br>
It will never change me and you<br>
Going out tonight<br>
Changes into something red<br>
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress<br>
Reminds her of a missing piece of innocence she lost<br>
We're only getting older baby<br>
And I've been thinking about it lately<br>
Does it ever drive you crazy<br>
Just how fast the night changes?<br>
Everything that you've ever dreamed of<br>
Disappearing when you wake up<br>
But there's nothing to be afraid of<br>
Even when the night changes<br>
It will never change, baby<br>
It will never change, baby<br>
It will never change me and you
