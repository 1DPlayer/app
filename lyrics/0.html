		You're insecure<br>
		Don't know what for<br>
		You're turning heads when you walk through the door<br>
		Don't need make-up, to cover up<br>
		Being the way that you are is enough<br>
		Everyone else in the room can see it<br>
		Everyone else but you<br>
		Baby you light up my world like nobody else<br>
		The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed<br>
		But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell<br>
		You don't know, oh oh<br>
		You don't know you're beautiful<br>
		If only you saw what I can see<br>
		You'll understand why I want you so desperately<br>
		Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe<br>
		You don't know, oh oh<br>
		You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh<br>
		That's what makes you beautiful<br>
		So come on, you got it wrong<br>
		To prove I'm right, I put it in a song<br>
		I don't know why, you're being shy<br>
		And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes<br>
		Everyone else in the room can see it<br>
		Everyone else but you<br>
		Baby you light up my world like nobody else<br>
		The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed<br>
		But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell<br>
		You don't know, oh oh<br>
		You don't know you're beautiful<br>
		If only you saw what I can see<br>

		Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe<br>
		You don't know, oh oh<br>
		You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh<br>
		That's what makes you beautiful<br>
		Baby you light up my world like nobody else<br>
		The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed<br>
		But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell<br>
		You don't know, oh oh<br>
